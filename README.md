This is a repository for the paper "Jets and Differential Linear Logic".

We prove that the category of vector bundles over a fixed smooth manifold and its corresponding category of convenient modules are models for intuitionistic differential linear logic. The exponential modality is modelled by composing the jet comonad, whose Kleisli category has linear differential operators as morphisms, with the more familiar distributional comonad, whose Kleisli category has smooth maps as morphisms. Combining the two comonads gives a new interpretation of the semantics of differential linear logic where the Kleisli morphisms are smooth local functionals, or equivalently, non-linear partial differential operators, and the codereliction map induces the functional derivative. This points towards a logic and hence computational theory of non-linear partial differential equations and their solutions based on variational calculus.
